# Before You Start

> <mark style="color:blue;">**Why writing code is less important than understanding the philosophy of the problem?**</mark>

Each programming languages are used for different  purpose. For individual compatibility and complexity they fit into their unique domains. Their syntax looks different but the fundamentals are the same. Main goal of different programming languages is  to make our life easier, not to make it complex . My point is that programming languages are just tools. You are the one who decides what to use and when to use. Happy coding!

Also it is very very important to be a master of your own domain. if you are  outside of programming environment then you must know why you should  use programming knowledge and how will you use it. Otherwise, it will go in vain. If you are a businessman,  you should know how programming will help your business to grow. If you are a social worker you should know how you can reach help to more people using the power of programming. If you are a Computer Science student then you already know the facts. Programming all alone is useless if it is not needed to make any task of our daily life easier and faster.

Steps that I wish I could follow when I started learning how to program:

1. What kind of problem do you want to solve?
2. What are the requirements? or what do you need to collect to solve that problem?
3. What tools do you need?
4. Do research and dive deep into the topic.
5. Take help from experienced persons (online/offline).
6. Never give up until you solve the problem.

I will try my best to explain the Object Oriented concept through my perspective with JavaScript. I am using JS because as a[ MERN Stack developer](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) I have to use JS frequently and I am  excited to experiment with this powerful tool.ðŸ¤©
